# 🎧 Headphones Website Project

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Specialization**.  
The goal is to build a **responsive landing page** for a fictional headphones company using only **HTML and CSS**, following the provided **Figma design**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implement a fully responsive website based on the Figma design file.
- Ensure compatibility with desktop and mobile views.
- Apply modern CSS techniques for layout, typography, and interactivity.
- No external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) are allowed — pure HTML and CSS only.

---

## 🎨 Design Details
- **Figma File**: [Duplicate to Drafts](https://www.figma.com) (log in to Figma, open the project, and select **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to edit).
- **Fonts**:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)

⚠️ *Note*: If the fonts are not installed on your machine, download them before working on the project.  
Some values in Figma may be floating-point numbers — round them as needed.
